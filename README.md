# Tutorial on Bayesian Statistics using Bayesian Data Analysis 3

This repository is the result of an independent study that I took on Bayesian Statistics. The tutorial was mainly based on the textbook
["Bayesian Data Analysis"][link1]  by Gelman et al. What you will find here are my attempts to solve some of the excercises and
replicate some sections of the book. 

I encourage you to submit additional solutions/replications or improvements. 

Enjoy!  
Fernando
